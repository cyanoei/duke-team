== PROJECT: Eggventory

== Overview

Eggventory (Engineering Got General Inventory) is an inventory management system that is specially designed to be used by lab technicians in Engineering labs. It was created to facilitate the tracking of movement of inventory in an Engineering
laboratory in an easy-to-use interface. Eggventory interprets user commands through a CLI with predictive search, and displays the inventory components in a GUI. 

== Summary of contributions

* *Feature: Minimum required quantity*
** What it does: Allows users to set a minimum required quantity of a stock. This the minimum amount of a particular stock that the inventory has to have on hand at any given time. After loans or lost items are recorded, Eggventory will warn users if the stock quantity has fallen below the minimum. Users can also request a list of stocks that are present in less than the minimum required quantity.

** Justification: Eggventory inherently can notify users when a stock has completely run out, but it is not reasonable to wait until the stock is completely depleted. Realistically, users would prefer to have some notice beforehand, to have time to order new stocks or track down overdue loans. This feature also allows the minimum value to be user-defined, depending the importance of the stock within the inventory.   

** Highlights: This feature requires careful integration with the "edit minimum", "loan" and "lost" functions. There are thus three different scenarios (detailed in the Developer Guide below) where checks have to be performed.

== *5.3.1 Parser*

(API: 
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/eggventory/logic/parsers/Parser.java[Parser.java],
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/eggventory/logic/parsers/ParseAdd.java[ParseAdd.java],
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/eggventory/logic/parsers/ParseDelete.java[ParseDelete.java], 
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/eggventory/logic/parsers/ParseEdit.java[ParseEdit.java],
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/eggventory/logic/parsers/ParseList.java[ParseList.java])

The parser is called by the main Eggventory class to parse user commands. It is responsible for processing command strings entered by the user, and returning Command objects that the main Eggventory class can execute.
 
The main Parser class

* Receives the user’s full input string as a parameter, and parses the first word, separated by a space.
* Determines, based on the first word, what kind of command the user is making.
** Directly creates the relevant Command object (for single word commands).
** Passes on the rest of the string to one of the Parser submodules (for multi-word commands).

_Placeholder for Fig. 5_

The Parser has 4 submodules: add, delete, edit and list. They are shown in Figure 5 above. These submodules handle multi-word commands from the user. 

The Parser submodules

* Each receives the rest of the string (without the first word) from the main parser as an input parameter.
* Determine what kind of object (Stock, StockType, etc) the user wants to work with.
* Parse any other parameters that follow.
* Create and return the relevant Command object.
 
Figure 6 below is a sequence diagram demonstrating how the entire parser module works. In this example, the user has entered the command “add stockType Resistor”.

*Design Consideration*

We have chosen to implement the parser module this way to abstract out the different levels of processing user inputs. The main Parser class is only concerned with determining what the first word is, and creating command objects for single word inputs. If a multi-word inputs are given, the main Parser only has to determine if the first word is a valid command type. Thereafter, it does not parse the rest of the input itself, but instead calls the relevant submodule to process the rest of the input string.

== 6.5 Setting and checking minimum required quantity
The tracking of the minimum required quantity of stocks is an additional feature on top of the basic Eggventory. The feature is a means for users to ensure that they get warnings when loans and lost items cause the quantity of their available stock to become lower than a value they have defined.

*6.5.1 Implementation*

It is implemented by storing a minimum attribute inside each stock class. The minimum required quantity is an optional parameter. Users can specify when adding new stocks if it has a minimum required quantity to keep. Otherwise, by default, the value of minimum is set to set to 0. The attribute can thereafter be updated using the edit command.

Checking of the minimum required quantity is required in three scenarios. 

* When the user decreases the total quantity of a stock.
* When loans of stock are made.
* When items are recorded as lost (directly changed to lost, or reported lost after being loaned out).

In each of these situations, an exception is thrown if the new total available quantity is lower than the minimum required quantity.
 
*6.5.2 List of insufficient stock*
 
To enable users to quickly determine which stocks need to be replenished, we can use an ArrayList (within the StockList class) to store a list of stocks which do not meet their minimum required quantity. The list would be displayed to the user with a single list command. When stocks are added or loans returned, checks will be performed within those commands to determine if the Stock can be removed from the list.
